Grade Checker

Overview:

Grade Checker is a data-driven project that helps users manage and track student grades. Using various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, this program allows users to:

-> Insert student records (name, grade, etc.)
-> Search for students based on specific criteria
-> Display students sorted by their grades in ascending or descending order

The project is implemented with a focus on DSA principles, including binary search trees, sorting algorithms, and hash maps to ensure efficiency and scalability.

Features:
1. Add New Student Records: Insert new student details, including name, gender, year, and grade.
2. Search for Students: Easily search for specific students by name or other attributes using optimized search algorithms.
3. Display Sorted List: View all students sorted by their grades (ascending or descending) using sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.
4. Dynamic Data Management: Handles the insertion and deletion of student records dynamically.
5. Efficient Searching: Leverages binary search trees for fast retrieval of student information.
